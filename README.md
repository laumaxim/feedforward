# feedforward
Python implementation of a simple artificial neural network (ANN)

The information in the network moves only in one direction, from the input layer through the hidden layer and to the output layer. Hence, it is a Feedforward neural network.
Each neuron in the current layer is connected to each neuron in the subsequent layer, it is a fully connected net.



## ToDo:
- Allow the use of different activation functions, like ReLu or tanh
- Allow a different kind of output layer
- Implement different kinds of loss functions
